1.121 2024-10-30
- call dnspkt->encode before dnspkt->header->id on new Net::DNS::Packet
  needed since Net::DNS 1.46

1.120 2021-02-26
- change bugtracker in Makefile.PL to github

1.119 2018-11-15
- quote fields like envelope-from correctly when writing Received-SPF

1.118 2018-10-29
- fixed potential busy loop with specific DNS responses
- ignore case when comparing answer from DNS to query

1.117 2018-09-24
- fixed mail header when pass_all matched to include reason etc
- add --passall option to samples/spflookup.pl

1.116 2018-09-01
- New option 'pass_all'. This can be used to override the 'pass' outcome
  in case a policy was detected which is designed to pass everything (very crude
  checks so far). Such policies are setup by spammers for their domains so that
  they get SPF pass even when sending from botnets.

1.115 2018-08-31
- Update module to support current RFC 7208 instead of the older RFC 4408. This
  means especially that DNS SPF records will be no longer used (only TXT).
  Compatibilty with RFC 4408 can be enabled.
- fix handling of ipv6 in mechanism 'a' and 'mx'. It now understands 
  a/24 (as before), a/24//64 and a//64 - the last two were wrongly considered 
  invalid before.

1.114 2018-03-09
- optionally have default SPF record which gets used for sites which don't
  specify their own. Since this affects often smaller sites something like
  'mx ~all' or 'mx/24 ~all' is useful.

1.113 2016-05-17
- fix bug in generating the Received-SPF header, introduced in 1.112
- samples/spf-lookup.pl has now option to specify DNS server

1.112 2015-12-16
- optimize debugging and make it usable from outsite (for
  Mail::DMARC::Iterator).
- method todo() to get a list of open DNS queries
- hash in result contains all the information which are also contained in
  the Received-SPF header, i.e. also client-ip, envelope-from...

1.111 2015-11-15
- adapt tests to recent changes in Net::DNS (use of undocumented function
  stopped working). RT#108914. Thanks to SREZIC

1.11 2012-06-02
- adapt to changed behavior in newer Net::DNS versions regarding
  encoding of special characters like spaces. Nothing changed for
  normal DNS names, only for the sometimes esoteric rfc4408 test suite

1.10 2011-08-30
- return ('') also if TXT was NXDOMAIN but SPF query is still open etc

1.09 2011-08-29
- let next() report ('') if given packet matched query, but got
  ignored or () if packet did not match any query, instead of 
  reporting () in both cases

1.08 2009-09-08
- fixed case where problem part in SPF-Received Header contained
  newlines

1.07 2009-08-31
- fix for SPF with multiple includes on same level where not the 
  first matches

1.06 2009-02-06
- fix for DNS names with spaces and Net::DNS <0.64 (for SPF test 
  suite, should be irrelevant for real life DNS names)

1.05_01 2009-02-02
- add test when ptr record results in cname which then results in
  another ptr record
1.05 2009-01-19
- work around changes between Net::DNS 0.63 and 0.64

1.04 2009-01-19
- fix bug in mailheader for empty or invalid SPF records

1.03 2008-12-07
- more useful debugging messages
- switch on debugging via use/import
- can set own debug function via use/import

1.02 2008-11-26
- document all fields in module
- report identity=helo in Received-SPF if helo, not mailfrom, is used
- fix and document regex in _check_macro_domain

1.01 2008-11-26
- lots of code cleanups to make it better maintainable
- detect and fix bug with deeply nested includes, where a Match
  (Pass) from a lower level gets directly propagated to the top
- detect and fix bugs, where final result (errors) where not
  saved in $self->{result}
- better SenderID support, some tests for SenderID records
- no more cbid in next(), instead track DNS header ids of send 
  DNS packets and make sure that reply matches id of query
- set minimal version for Net::DNS to 0.62 , older versions have 
  problems with SPF
- more tests

1.00 2008-11-25
- declare all $self as Mail::SPF::Iterator object
- add method to get/set default explanation string
- call it feature complete -> set version to 1.0

0.10 2008-11-24
- license clarification for SPF test suite in COPYRIGHT and add
  t/rfc4408-tests.LICENSE to distribution
- documentation update
- samples/spflookup shows explanation on Fail

0.09 2008-11-24
- internal restructuring, better checking that DNS answers match
  the question
- expansion of %{p} in exp= modifier
- more tests outside of official SPF test suite

0.08 2008-11-22
- accepts also SenderID records (only spf2.0/mfrom or 
  spf2.0/pra,mfrom or spf2.0/mfrom,pra) and handle them like 
  v=spf1 records. Prefer "real" SPF records

0.07 2008-11-22
- %{p} macro gets now expanded in TXT for explain (but still not in
  exp=..%{p}.. modifiers)
- method result to get result (before next gives the final result,
  in case one don't want to lookup %{p} in explain)
- method mailheader doesn't take arguments anymore, because result
  gets stored in the object

0.06 2008-11-21
- exp method works for most cases, except when it contains %{p} macro
  which in most cases will be replaced with 'unknown'
- fix for interpretation of %{i} for IP6
- better debugging
- script samples/spflookup.pl which does lookup from the command line
  and returns SPF-Received header

0.05 2008-11-20
- sub mailheader which gives SPF-Received header
- sub lookup_blocking for simple blocking lookup (for convinience)
- clean up 'problem' messages, returns mechanism which matcht
- better debugging

0.04 2008-11-20
- do not depend on additional DNS RR for resolving CNAME and finding 
  address for MX but still use them if found
  test suite expanded to test with and w/o additional RR
- do not depend on YAML for executing SPF test suite. The YAML file
  is converted to perl file (with Data::Dumper) which is used instead
  of the YAML file

0.03 2008-11-19
- fixes for Socket6 detection
- fixes for test suite
- fixes for cases, where DNS name contains special chars (qname from
  Net::DNS::Question returns presentation format, not wire format, if
  it got the data from the wire)

0.02 2008-11-17
- specify URI as prereq
- if YAML is not installed show why test suite got skipped
- skip parts of test suite of Socket6 not installed

0.01 2008-11-13
- first release which passes SPF test suite
